### Chapter 1 - Introduction

* Computer Organization - Addresses issues such as control signals, signaling methods, and memory types. How does a comp. work?
* Computer Architecture - Focuses on the structure and behavior of the computer system. How do I design a computer?
* Principle of Equivalence of Hardware and Sofware - <i>any task done by software can also be done using hardware, and any hardware operation performed directly by hardware can be done using software.</i>
