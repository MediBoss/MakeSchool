<i>By Linda Null and Julia Lobur</i>

### Why Learn about Computer System...
  * In case we need a program to be faster
  * In case we need a program to be efficient
  * Or when the App isn't doing precisly what it's intended
  
  <i>Successful computer professionals continually add to their knowledge about how computers work.</i>
  
  
## Vocabularies

* ISA - Instruction Set  Architecture(Interface between all softwares that runs on the machine and the hardware)

### Chapter 1 - Introduction

* <b>Computer Organization</b> - Addresses issues such as control signals, signaling methods, and memory types. How does a comp. work?
* <b>Computer Architecture</b> - Focuses on the structure and behavior of the computer system. How do I design a computer?
* <b>Principle of Equivalence of Hardware and Sofware</b> - <i>any task done by software can also be done using hardware, and any hardware operation performed directly by hardware can be done using software.</i>
* <b>Bus</b> - Responsible for all data movement internal to the computer.
* <b>Ports</b> - Allow movement of data to and from devices external to the computer.
* <b>Graphics Processing Units(GPU)</b> - Handles all calculations to render graphics.
* <b>Control unit</b> - makes sure that instructions are decoded and executed properlyand that data is moved where when it should be.


#### Basicl Level components needed to build a computing system:

  * A processor - Interprets and executes programs.
  * A memory - Stores both data and programs.
  * A mechanism - Trasnfers data to and from the outside world.
