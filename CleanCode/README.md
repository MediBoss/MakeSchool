# Clean Code

### Overview
This part of the Notebook will solely focus on code craftsmanship. It will also cover best practices to write clean code. The book covered in this section is <a href><i>Clean code in Python</i></a> by Mariano Anaya.

### Definition
Clean code is about achieving quality software and building system that is robust, maintanable, and avoiding technical debts.


### Adhering to a style guide
It is extensively important for all members of a developing team to agree on a standarized way of structuring code. This will make it easier for teammates and other developers to find their way around the code base. Each language has its own style guide but the devloper community have come up with some:

* Python's <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP-8 style guide</a>
* Javascript's <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript">Airbnb Style guide</a>
* Swift's <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/swift">Airbnb Style guide</a>
* Ruby's <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/ruby">Airbnb Style guide</a>
